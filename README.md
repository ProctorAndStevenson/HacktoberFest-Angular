# HacktoberfestAngular

Welcome to HacktoberFest Angular. This is your personalised SandBox to have a play with the framework and show us what you can do. 

The setup is simple:
- make sure you have Node installed
- make a fork of the repository to your gitHub account
- clone the repository
- run `npm install` 
- run `nmp run start`
- make a copy of the 0_dummy folder and rename it your own (it has the bare bone structure for your project)
- add your page data in the data.ts array inside the core directory 
- create a feature branch to work on
- start making some magic!
- submit a pull request to us.

These are example of things you could make and PR you could raise:
- You've successfully renamed and setup a copy of the dummy directory to redirect to my own module (you deserve a PR reward for that!)
- You've created a reusable components you can loop through (no need to go fancy)
- You've created a custom directives/pipes to modify data or listen to events on the DOM
- You've created a component that uses a service to do something
- You've set up a store
- You've set up an animation on a component
- You've experimented with ng-template, ng-container, ng-content, ngTemplateOuter

The possibilities are endless! Let's just practice some Angular this October :)
